# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-15
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 12

## Overview

Build a markdown-based slash command system for business framework design. Start with project structure and scaffolding, then implement core canvas frameworks (BMC, Lean, VPC, SWOT), followed by advanced frameworks (Personas, Competitive, Market Sizing), and finish with integration features (entity linking, project management, WebSearch).

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: Set up project structure, storage patterns, and command scaffolding
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Project structure and storage model
- [x] 01-02: Base command template and shared utilities

### Phase 2: Framework Commands

**Goal**: Implement core business canvas commands (BMC, Lean, VPC, SWOT)
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Business Model Canvas command
- [x] 02-02: Lean Canvas command
- [x] 02-03: Value Proposition Canvas command
- [x] 02-04: SWOT Analysis command

### Phase 3: Advanced Frameworks

**Goal**: Implement advanced analysis frameworks (Personas, Competitive, Market Sizing)
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: User Personas command
- [x] 03-02: Competitive Analysis command
- [x] 03-03: Market Sizing command

### Phase 4: Integration

**Goal**: Add entity linking, project management, and WebSearch integration
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Project management commands (create, list, view)
- [x] 04-02: Entity linking between frameworks
- [x] 04-03: WebSearch integration for research

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Timestamp-based IDs (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS) for natural chronological ordering
- Dual file output (JSON + MD) for programmatic use and human readability
- Entity linking types: targets, informs, complements, validates
- Conversation-style prompting: Entry point -> follow-up -> probing -> decision gate
- Conductor command structure: Frontmatter + XML body
- 5-step process pattern: check_project -> gather_info -> create_entity -> update_project -> confirm
- Framework categorization: Canvas Frameworks vs Analysis Frameworks
- Five research focus options: market, competitors, customers, technology, general

**Issues Resolved:**

None encountered during milestone.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None - clean implementation following established patterns.
