# Roadmap: Business Design

## Overview

Build a markdown-based slash command system for business framework design. Start with project structure and scaffolding, then implement core canvas frameworks (BMC, Lean, VPC, SWOT), followed by advanced frameworks (Personas, Competitive, Market Sizing), and finish with integration features (entity linking, project management, WebSearch).

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

- [x] **Phase 1: Foundation** - Project structure and command scaffolding
- [x] **Phase 2: Framework Commands** - BMC, Lean Canvas, VPC, SWOT commands
- [x] **Phase 3: Advanced Frameworks** - Personas, Competitive Analysis, Market Sizing
- [ ] **Phase 4: Integration** - Entity linking, project management, WebSearch

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Goal**: Set up project structure, storage patterns, and command scaffolding
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Research**: Unlikely (established patterns from conductor reference)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Project structure and storage model
- [x] 01-02: Base command template and shared utilities

### Phase 2: Framework Commands
**Goal**: Implement core business canvas commands (BMC, Lean, VPC, SWOT)
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Research**: Unlikely (adapting existing MCP schemas)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Business Model Canvas command
- [x] 02-02: Lean Canvas command
- [x] 02-03: Value Proposition Canvas command
- [x] 02-04: SWOT Analysis command

### Phase 3: Advanced Frameworks
**Goal**: Implement advanced analysis frameworks (Personas, Competitive, Market Sizing)
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Research**: Unlikely (same pattern as Phase 2)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: User Personas command
- [x] 03-02: Competitive Analysis command
- [x] 03-03: Market Sizing command

### Phase 4: Integration
**Goal**: Add entity linking, project management, and WebSearch integration
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Research**: Likely (WebSearch integration patterns)
**Research topics**: Claude WebSearch tool patterns, entity relationship models for framework linking
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Project management commands (create, list, view)
- [ ] 04-02: Entity linking between frameworks
- [x] 04-03: WebSearch integration for research
