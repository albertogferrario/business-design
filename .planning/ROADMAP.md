# Roadmap: Business Design

## Overview

Build a markdown-based slash command system for business framework design. Start with project structure and scaffolding, then implement core canvas frameworks (BMC, Lean, VPC, SWOT), followed by advanced frameworks (Personas, Competitive, Market Sizing), and finish with integration features (entity linking, project management, WebSearch).
