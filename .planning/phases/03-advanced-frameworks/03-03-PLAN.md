<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create biz:market command</name>
  <files>commands/business/biz-market.md</files>
  <action>
Create conductor-style command following established pattern:

1. Frontmatter:
   - name: biz:market
   - description: Create a Market Sizing analysis
   - allowed-tools: [Read, Write, Bash, Glob, AskUserQuestion]

2. Objective section explaining Market Sizing purpose (opportunity quantification)

3. Context section referencing lib files

4. Process with 5 steps:
   - check_project: Verify .planning/business/project.json exists
   - gather_info: Conversational prompting following lib/prompts.md:
     * Entry point: "What's the total market for what you're offering?"
     * TAM (Total Addressable Market) - 100% of market value
     * SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market) - realistic portion addressable
     * SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market) - capturable in timeframe
     * Probing questions:
       - Methodology (top-down vs bottom-up)
       - Sources
       - Assumptions
       - Growth rate and drivers
     * Decision gate for user control
   - create_entity: Generate ID, write JSON per lib/types.md, write MD summary
   - update_project: Add entity reference to project.json
   - confirm: Display creation summary with next steps

5. Output section listing files created/updated

6. Success criteria matching biz-bmc.md pattern

Note: Market Sizing requires numeric values with currency and unit. Guide users to provide specific numbers (e.g., "$50M USD annually") rather than vague ranges.
