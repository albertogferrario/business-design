<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create biz:competitive command</name>
  <files>commands/business/biz-competitive.md</files>
  <action>
Create conductor-style command following established pattern:

1. Frontmatter:
   - name: biz:competitive
   - description: Create a Competitive Analysis
   - allowed-tools: [Read, Write, Bash, Glob, AskUserQuestion]

2. Objective section explaining Competitive Analysis purpose (market landscape)

3. Context section referencing lib files

4. Process with 5 steps:
   - check_project: Verify .planning/business/project.json exists
   - gather_info: Conversational prompting following lib/prompts.md:
     * Entry point: "Who are your main competitors?"
     * For each competitor:
       - Basics (name, website)
       - Strengths (what they do well)
       - Weaknesses (where they fall short)
       - Positioning (target audience, pricing)
     * Then for our position:
       - Differentiators
       - Gaps
       - Opportunities
     * Probing questions for market share, pricing models, ideal customers
     * Decision gate for user control
   - create_entity: Generate ID, write JSON per lib/types.md, write MD summary
   - update_project: Add entity reference to project.json
   - confirm: Display creation summary with next steps

5. Output section listing files created/updated

6. Success criteria matching biz-bmc.md pattern
