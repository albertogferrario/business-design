<objective>
Create project structure with commands directory and storage utilities for local `.planning/business/` storage.

Purpose: Establish the foundation for all business framework commands — directory structure, storage patterns, and type definitions.
Output: Commands directory structure, storage utility library, and core type definitions.

Reference implementations for patterns:
- Conductor command format: `../conductor/commands/dev/` structure
- MCP storage patterns: `../business-design-mcp/src/storage/index.ts`
- MCP type definitions: `../business-design-mcp/src/schemas/index.ts`

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create commands directory with first command</name>
  <files>commands/business/biz-new-project.md</files>
  <action>
Create `commands/business/` directory. Create `biz-new-project.md` as the first command — this initializes a business design project within `.planning/business/`.

The command should:
1. Use conductor-style frontmatter (name, description, allowed-tools)
2. Have XML structure (objective, context, process with steps, output, success_criteria)
3. Create `.planning/business/project.json` with project metadata (name, description, createdAt, entities: [])
4. Create `.planning/business/` directory if needed

Follow the conductor pattern from `../conductor/commands/dev/new-project.md` but adapted for business framework initialization.

Command name: `biz:new-project`

  <name>Task 2: Create storage utilities reference</name>
  <files>lib/storage.md</files>
  <action>
Create `lib/storage.md` — a reference document that defines the storage patterns and file structures for business framework data.

Document should define:
1. Storage location: `.planning/business/` within project directories
2. File naming conventions:
   - `project.json` — project metadata
   - `{entity-type}/{id}.json` — individual entities (e.g., `bmc/001.json`)
   - `{entity-type}/{id}.md` — human-readable summaries
3. JSON structure templates for:
   - Project (id, name, description, createdAt, updatedAt, entities[])
   - Entity reference (id, type, name, createdAt)
4. ID generation pattern (timestamp-based: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-random`)
5. File reading/writing patterns using standard tools (Read, Write, Bash)

This is a reference document for commands to follow, not executable code.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create type definitions reference</name>
  <files>lib/types.md</files>
  <action>
Create `lib/types.md` — a reference document defining the data structures for all business frameworks.

Document the complete field structure for each framework type, adapted from MCP schemas:

1. **BusinessModelCanvas** — 9 blocks:
   - customerSegments (segment, characteristics?, size?)
   - valuePropositions (proposition, customerPains?, customerGains?)
   - channels (channel, phase?)
   - customerRelationships (relationship, type?)
   - revenueStreams (stream, type?, pricing?)
   - keyResources (resource, type?)
   - keyActivities (activity, type?)
   - keyPartnerships (partner, type?, motivation?)
   - costStructure (cost, type?)

2. **LeanCanvas** — startup adaptation:
   - problem (problem, existingAlternatives?)
   - customerSegments (segment, earlyAdopters?)
   - uniqueValueProposition (proposition, highLevelConcept?)
   - solution (feature, description?)
   - channels (string array)
   - revenueStreams (stream, amount?)
   - costStructure (cost, amount?)
   - keyMetrics (metric, target?)
   - unfairAdvantage (string)

3. **ValuePropositionCanvas** — customer-value fit:
   - customerProfile (customerJobs, pains, gains)
   - valueMap (productsAndServices, painRelievers, gainCreators)
   - fitScore (number, optional)

4. **SwotAnalysis** — strategic positioning:
   - strengths (item, impact?)
   - weaknesses (item, impact?, mitigation?)
   - opportunities (item, timeframe?, requiredAction?)
   - threats (item, likelihood?, contingency?)
   - context (string, optional)

5. **UserPersona** — customer archetypes:
   - demographics (age?, gender?, location?, occupation?, income?, education?, familyStatus?)
   - psychographics (personality?, values?, interests?, lifestyle?)
   - behavior (goals, frustrations, motivations, preferredChannels?, buyingBehavior?)
   - quote?, bio?, scenario?

6. **CompetitiveAnalysis** — market landscape:
   - competitors[] (name, website?, description?, strengths[], weaknesses[], pricing?, marketShare?, targetAudience?)
   - ourPosition (differentiators[], gaps[], opportunities[])

7. **MarketSizing** — opportunity quantification:
   - tam (value, currency, unit, methodology?, sources?, assumptions?)
   - sam (value, currency, unit, constraints?, targetSegments?)
   - som (value, currency, unit, timeframe?, captureStrategy?, assumptions?)
   - growthRate (rate, period, drivers?)

Include common fields for all entities: id, projectId, name, type, description?, createdAt, updatedAt, linkedEntities?

This serves as the canonical reference for all command implementations.
