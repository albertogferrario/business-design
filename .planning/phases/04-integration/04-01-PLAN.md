<objective>
Implement project management commands for listing and viewing business design entities.

Purpose: Allow users to see what frameworks exist in their project and view individual entity details.
Output: Two new commands (biz:list, biz:view) following established conductor patterns.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create biz:list command</name>
  <files>commands/business/biz-list.md</files>
  <action>
Create command to list all business design entities in the current project.

Structure:
1. Check project exists (read .planning/business/project.json)
2. If no project: prompt user to run biz:new-project
3. List entities from project.json entities array
4. Display in table format: Type | Name | Created | ID
5. Group by framework type (Canvas Frameworks, Analysis Frameworks)
6. Show count summary at end

Follow conductor pattern:
- Frontmatter: name, description, allowed-tools (Read, Glob)
- XML structure with objective, context, process (steps), output, success_criteria

Handle empty state: "No frameworks created yet. Use biz:bmc, biz:lean, etc. to create your first."
  </action>
  <verify>File exists at commands/business/biz-list.md with complete conductor structure</verify>
  <done>Command follows conductor pattern, handles all cases (no project, empty project, populated project)</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create biz:view command</name>
  <files>commands/business/biz-view.md</files>
  <action>
Create command to view a specific business design entity by ID.

Structure:
1. Accept entity ID as argument (from biz:list output)
2. Check project exists
3. Look up entity in project.json entities array
4. If not found: display error with available IDs
5. Read entity JSON from .planning/business/{type}/{id}.json
6. Display formatted output using lib/formatting.md patterns
7. Show linked entities if any exist

Follow conductor pattern:
- Frontmatter: name, description, allowed-tools (Read, Bash, Glob)
- XML structure with objective, context, process, output, success_criteria

Handle errors:
- No project: "Run biz:new-project first"
- ID not found: "Entity {id} not found. Available: {list from project.json}"
- File missing: "Entity data file missing at {path}"
  </action>
  <verify>File exists at commands/business/biz-view.md with complete conductor structure</verify>
  <done>Command accepts ID argument, displays entity details, handles all error cases</done>
</task>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] commands/business/biz-list.md exists with valid conductor structure
- [ ] commands/business/biz-view.md exists with valid conductor structure
- [ ] Both commands handle missing project case
- [ ] Both commands handle empty/error cases gracefully
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All tasks completed
- Both commands follow established conductor pattern
- Error messages guide users to correct actions
- Commands integrate with existing biz:help output
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-integration/04-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
