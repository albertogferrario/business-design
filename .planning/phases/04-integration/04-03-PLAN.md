<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create biz:research command</name>
  <files>commands/business/biz-research.md</files>
  <action>
Create command to research business topics using Claude's WebSearch tool.

Usage: biz:research [topic]

Structure:
1. Accept research topic as argument (or prompt if not provided)
2. Ask for research focus:
   - market: Market trends and industry analysis
   - competitors: Competitive landscape research
   - customers: Target audience and user behavior
   - technology: Technology trends and solutions
   - general: Open-ended business research
3. Construct search query based on topic + focus
4. Use WebSearch tool to gather information
5. Synthesize results into business-relevant insights
6. Format output as structured research summary:
   - Key Findings (3-5 bullet points)
   - Market Insights (if applicable)
   - Competitive Insights (if applicable)
   - Recommendations (2-3 action items)
   - Sources (list of URLs used)

Follow conductor pattern with frontmatter and XML structure.
Allowed tools: WebSearch, Read, Write

Output options:
- Display: Show research summary in conversation
- Save: Optionally save to .planning/business/research/{topic-slug}.md
  </action>
  <verify>File exists at commands/business/biz-research.md with complete conductor structure</verify>
  <done>Command uses WebSearch, synthesizes business insights, formats output clearly</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add research storage and retrieval</name>
  <files>commands/business/biz-research.md</files>
  <action>
Extend biz:research to save and list past research.

Add capabilities:
1. After displaying research, ask: "Save this research? (y/n)"
2. If yes:
   - Generate slug from topic (lowercase, hyphens)
   - Create .planning/business/research/ directory if needed
   - Save as {timestamp}-{slug}.md with full research output
   - Include metadata: topic, focus, date, sources

3. Add listing mode: biz:research --list
   - List saved research files by date
   - Show topic and date for each
   - Provide hint: "Use biz:research --view {filename} to read"

4. Add view mode: biz:research --view {filename}
   - Read and display saved research file

Update command documentation to show all modes:
- biz:research [topic] — Conduct new research
- biz:research --list — List saved research
- biz:research --view [file] — View saved research
  </action>
  <verify>Command supports --list and --view flags, saves research to .planning/business/research/</verify>
  <done>Research can be saved, listed, and retrieved; all modes documented</done>
</task>
